- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @evekhm
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in sleep disorders, such as parasomnias and narcolepsy.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to do video processing and ML in order to analyze videos recorded by the camera throughout the night based on the motion detection.
-  My next goal is to build a HealthySleep App on top of the video analysis integrated with other wearables, such as Oura ring, Wiithins, FitBit, etc...
